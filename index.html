            <p class="projdes sumlil">For Sumlilthings' "Gamer Collection" event, I designed a charming collection of pixel art assets that resonated with the gaming audience. By conducting extensive research, I transformed standard assets into unique characters that appealed to their vast customer base of over 100,000 individuals. The retro '90s style and captivating design resulted in a successful event for Sumlilthings.

                <h2 class="about-me-header">Education 👨‍🎓</h2>
                <p>I'm Nicholas, a designer with a passion for bringing ideas to life. I graduated from SJSU with a degree in Design Studies and a specialization in Graphic Design, where I honed my skills in visual communication, branding, and user experience.</p> 
                <h2 class="about-me-header">My Path to Design 🧭</h2>    
                 <p>As a child, I loved to be creative and make my own toys because I couldn't always find what I wanted in stores. I was never content with following instructions to Lego guides and preferred to create things that popped up in my mind. In university, I realized that I wanted to use my skills to bring people's ideas to life and help them pursue their dreams. That's when I fell in love with design, and I've been pursuing it ever since.</p>   
                <h2 class="about-me-header">Hobbies 🥋</h2>
                <p>When I'm not designing, I'm often practicing Wushu, a Chinese martial art that I've been doing for 17 years. Wushu has taught me many things, including discipline, resilience, and focus. I've learned to apply the same principles that I use in Wushu to my everyday life, such as pushing through growing pains and overcoming obstacles. These lessons have been invaluable to me, both as a designer and as a person.</p>
