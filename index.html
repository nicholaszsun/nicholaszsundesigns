            <p class="projdes sumlil">My task for Sumlilthings' "Gamer Collection" event was to design a charming collection of pixel art assets using a retro '90s style that resonates with the gaming audience. By conducting extensive research, I created unique characters and transformed Sumlilthings' standard assets into captivating ones that appealed to their vast customer base of over 100,000 individuals.

            <p class="projdes UC">Utilizing my design skills, I successfully created a shirt design for the U.C. Berkeley Wushu Team's competition, resulting in a sold-out merchandise line. The design not only resonated with the event's 150 competitors but also captured the dynamic essence of wushu. Meeting the challenge of a tight deadline and budget constraints, I delivered a visually appealing design that exceeded expectations and contributed to the team's success.</p>

                <h2 class="about-me-header">Education</h2>
                <p>I'm Nicholas, a designer with a passion for bringing ideas to life. I graduated from SJSU with a degree in Design Studies and a specialization in Graphic Design, where I honed my skills in visual communication, branding, and user experience.</p> 
                <h2 class="about-me-header">My Path to Design</h2>    
                 <p>As a child, I loved to be creative and make my own toys because I couldn't always find what I wanted in stores. I was never content with following instructions to Lego guides and preferred to create things that popped up in my mind. In university, I realized that I wanted to use my skills to bring people's ideas to life and help them pursue their dreams. That's when I fell in love with design, and I've been pursuing it ever since.</p>   
                <h2 class="about-me-header">Hobbies</h2>
                <p>When I'm not designing, I'm often practicing Wushu, a Chinese martial art that I've been doing for 17 years. Wushu has taught me many things, including discipline, resilience, and focus. I've learned to apply the same principles that I use in Wushu to my everyday life, such as pushing through growing pains and overcoming obstacles. These lessons have been invaluable to me, both as a designer and as a person.</p>
