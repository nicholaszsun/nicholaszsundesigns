            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The U.C. Berkeley Wushu Team approached me with an exciting opportunity to design a shirt for their upcoming competition. With the event just around the corner, I embarked on the challenge of creating a design that would not only meet their tight deadline but also stay within their budget constraints. It was a thrilling challenge to bring to life a design that would not only resonate with the competitors and judges of the event but also represent the dynamic art of wushu.

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>Design a shirt for the 2023 Wushu Collegiate Competition for U.C Berkeleys Wushu Team, that effectively captures the spirit of the event while also being a timeless piece that can be cherished by competitors and fans for years to come. The design must showcase the skill, strength, and precision required to excel in the sport of Wushu and feature an aesthetic that conveys a sense of sophistication and elegance.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>To create a design that would leave a lasting impression on the Wushu competition, I delved deeply into the essential elements that define the sport of Wushu. As I examined a variety of wushu designs, I noticed that many of them featured silhouettes of athletes in motion, highlighting the intricate and dynamic movements that are at the heart of this sport.
            </p>
            <div class="picture-container research">

            </div>
            <p>However, I also recognized that while these designs effectively conveyed the spirit of wushu, they often appeared too complex and outdated to capture the sport's essence in a timeless way. Thus, I sought to strike a balance between showcasing the dynamic movement and athleticism of wushu while creating a design that was modern, timeless, and sure to make a lasting impact.

            </div>
            <p>To find this fresh approach, I looked to the logos of past Olympic Games, which beautifully conveyed the spirit of their respective sports in a timeless and simplistic manner. By carefully analyzing these iconic designs, I was able to draw inspiration for creating a shirt design that would be both captivating and memorable for competitors and fans alike.</p>

    <section class="sect designprocess">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>To begin my design process, I started by sketching out various silhouettes that depicted the unique poses and stances commonly used by Wushu athletes.</p>
            <div class="picture-container research2">
                <img class="research-pic"src="images/Project 2 Images/Inital Sketches/first sketch.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Building upon the initial sketches, I continued to refine the design by simplifying the features of the silhouette, using clean and abstract shapes to create a visually striking and memorable image.</p>
            <div class="picture-container research3">
                <img class="research-pic2"src="images/Project 2 Images/Inital Sketches/Sketches.jpg" alt="">
                <img class="research-pic2"src="images/Project 2 Images/Design Process/Cwushu Design Process-01.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>I came to realize that my first idea was a bit too abstract that the pose I was trying to convey was too dynamic and was hard to understand and relate to the event.</p>
            <p>Drawing inspiration from the upcoming year of the competition, 2023, I incorporated the numerals into the design by using a "2" for the upper body of the character and a "3" for the lower body. Through numerous iterations and revisions, I was able to seamlessly fuse the elegant movements of wushu with a nod to the event and year, resulting in a design that perfectly captures the spirit of the competition while remaining timeless and iconic.</p>
            <div class="picture-container research2">
                <img class="research-pic"src="images/Project 2 Images/Inital Sketches/ver2 sketch.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Following the initial sketches, I digitized the designs and carefully considered the best approach for adding color to the character. As the designs were to be printed onto shirts, it was important to limit the number of colors to keep costs down. I collaborated closely with the design coordinator of the UC Berkeley Wushu Team to research the base shirt costs and determine the optimal number of colors for the design, ultimately striking the perfect balance between cost-effectiveness and visual impact.</p>
            <div class="picture-container research3">
                <img class="research-pic2"src="images/Project 2 Images/Design Process/Cwushu Design Process-09.png" alt="">

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Once the main logo design was completed, I moved on to the placement of the logo on the front and back of the shirts. The wording of the event was a bit tricky as we debated between using "2023 Wushu competition" or "2023 Wushu Games", but after discussions with the design coordinator, we settled on "2023 Collegiate Tournament". This decision perfectly encapsulated the nature of the event, while also adding a professional touch to the design.</p>
            <div class="picture-container research2">
                <img class="research-pic2"src="images/Project 2 Images/Design Process/Cwushu Design Process-10.png" alt="">
            </div>    
            <p>The next challenge was to design a special shirt for the judges that would be easily distinguishable from the regular ones. At first, I considered just changing some of the wording and adding "judge" to the design, but we decided that creating a separate design with a different base color would be more cost-effective than submitting two different designs.</p>
            <div class="picture-container research2">
                <img class="research-pic2"src="images/Project 2 Images/Design Process/Cwushu Design Process-11.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>To complete the shirt design, I focused on the back portion. As the event was hosted by UC Berkeley, I wanted to include some recognizable landmarks from their campus. After careful consideration, I chose to feature Sather Gates, the UC Berkeley bear, and their tower. These elements not only identified with the university but also added a sense of school pride to the design.</p>
            <div class="picture-container research2">
                <img class="research-pic2"src="images/Project 2 Images/Design Process/Cwushu Design Process-04.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Creating a design that incorporated UC Berkeley's landmarks while maintaining the integrity of the original design was a challenge that required a lot of time and effort. I experimented with various variations until I found the perfect balance, taking care not to overshadow the main design. Working closely with the design coordinator, we were able to collaborate on the final design that perfectly captured the spirit of the event and the essence of UC Berkeley.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This project served as a valuable test of time management and effective communication with management and stakeholders. While I was able to complete the design within the designated two-week timeframe, I found myself investing more hours than initially anticipated. This was partly due to my lack of experience effectively communicating with the design coordinators. I considered too many of their suggestions, resulting in significant design revisions that prolonged the process.</p>
            <p>Reflecting on this experience, I now recognize the importance of maintaining clear and open communication with stakeholders while still asserting my expertise as a trusted designer. By striking a balance between incorporating feedback and expressing my own design choices, I can streamline the revision process and ensure that the final design reflects both the client's vision and my creative expertise.</p>
