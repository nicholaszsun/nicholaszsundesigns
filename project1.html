          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <div class="">
            <p>In this exciting project, I had the pleasure of working on a commission piece for Sumlilthings' highly anticipated "Gamer Collection" event. My mission was to design pixel art assets for seven distinct characters, each with its own unique flair and personality. The ultimate objective was to transform Sumlilthings' standard characters into a retro, throwback â€™90s style that would resonate deeply with their gaming audience. To achieve this, I immersed myself in the world of classic gaming and studied timeless assets that would be recognizable to both young and old audiences. The end result was a stunning collection of pixel art assets that perfectly captured the essence of the gaming world, infusing it with a sense of nostalgia and timeless appeal.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>During this phase, I studied the most successful games and consoles of the 1990s to understand the limitations that artists faced when creating pixel art assets. By examining the resolution constraints of these consoles, the optimal resolution for the project's characters was determined. The color palettes and art styles from iconic games like Pokemon and Super Mario were used as references to guide the development of the characters, which had a limited color palette of 5-8 colors and were sized at 16x16 pixels. These findings were applied to the project, resulting in the creation of visually appealing characters reminiscent of classic games from that era of gaming.</p>
