            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>As the project lead, my responsibilities encompassed a wide range of design tasks, including conceptualizing a new logo, crafting visually stunning flyers, designing two impactful poster boards, creating bespoke business cards and merchandise, and crafting custom shirts for the team and their students.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>Starting off I made sure to understand what the school's core values are and what type of service they are providing. This way I can understand the messaging of what the logo should be.</p>
            <p>After communicating with the team I wrote down the key takeaways of their company and their services.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>As the project began, my first step was to brainstorm various logo ideas that would capture the essence of 720 Martial Arts. Knowing that the school was going to be a modern wushu institution, I realized that a minimalist design with the number "720" would be the most fitting and impactful choice. By utilizing a sleek and simple design, I aimed to create a logo that was not only visually striking but also conveyed the school's commitment to quality instruction and modernity.</p>
            <p>Initially, my first sketch involved experimenting with various sporty-looking fonts for the number "720." However, I soon realized that I lacked a clear understanding of the significance behind the number, which made it difficult to create a logo that truly resonated with the school's identity. As a result, I knew that I needed to dig deeper and gain a better understanding of the school's ethos and values to create a logo that accurately represented them.</p>
            <div class="picture-container research">
                <img class="research-pic2"src="images/Project 3 img/Research Process Images/initial ver 1.jpg" alt="">
                <img class="research-pic2"src="images/Project 3 img/Research Process Images/initial ver 3.jpg" alt="">
                <img class="research-pic2"src="images/Project 3 img/Research Process Images/initial ver 2.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>To develop a logo that truly captured the spirit of 720 Martial Arts, I turned to inspiration from logos created for the World Wushu Games. Drawing on these examples, I began crafting simple yet striking silhouettes of a Wushu athlete executing a 720-degree jump.</p>
            <p>At this point, it was then getting too complex and now is looking more like an event logo rather than a logo for a brand.</p>
            <div class="picture-container research3">
                <img class="research-pic2"src="images/Project 3 img/Research Process Images/sec ver 1.jpg" alt="">
                <img class="research-pic2"src="images/Project 3 img/Research Process Images/sec ver 2.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>My exploration into the meaning behind the number 720 didn't stop at the athlete's execution of the challenging jump. I dug even deeper, observing how the athlete's body looked like a powerful, swirling tornado as they spun rapidly in the air. This insight was a true breakthrough in the design process, and it inspired me to incorporate the shape of a tornado into the logo.</p>
            <div class="picture-container research3">
                <img class="research-pic2"src="images/Project 3 img/Research Process Images/third ver 1.jpg" alt="">
                <img class="research-pic2"src="images/Project 3 img/Research Process Images/third ver 2.jpg" alt="">
            </div> 
            <p>The final product was nothing short of spectacular - a minimalist and modern design that conveyed a sense of complexity and movement through the carefully crafted shape of the tornado. The logo exuded a sense of elite athleticism, perfectly encapsulating the challenging nature of the 720-degree jump. By seamlessly integrating this deeper meaning into the design, I was able to create a logo that not only captured the essence of the sport but also represented the values and mission of 720 Martial Arts.</p>  
            <div class="picture-container research2">
                <img class="research-pic2"src="images/Project 3 img/Research Process Images/third ver 3.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>With this logo, I started to digitize the final sketch and started the exploration of colors. I researched the meaning of certain colors and matched them with the values of the school.</p>
            <div class="picture-container research2">
                <img class="research-pic2"src="images/Project 3 img/Research Process Images/720 Logo Color Choice-01-01.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>I found that the color orange represented the school the best. The warmth that the color orange gives, creates a sense of positivity, creativity, and community that aligns with the school's values of community and inviting quality instruction.</p>

            <h2>Final Products</h2>
            <p>With the logo completed, I then took on the task of designing impactful banners, stickers, flyers, posters, and merch for the team's advertising needs. Meticulously crafted to align with the brand's identity, these promotional materials were designed to captivate audiences, spread awareness, and leave a lasting impression on potential customers. The end result was a visually striking and cohesive set of marketing assets that effectively showcased the schools offerings.</p>
